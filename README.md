# Unity-FDTD

A Unity, compute shader-based implementation of the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method for simulation of elastic waves in solids. The simulation allows multiple materials, multiple sources, and any arbitrary geometry - including realtime mesh importing. 


Since the simulation is run purely on the GPU, it can render the result in real-time. This is performed using two different volumetric rendering methods - the Direct Volume Method and the Maximum Intensity Projection.
